Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

I have a pretty clear understanding. They are looking are evaluating different covid mitigation methods.

Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

I think the methodology would make sense. I would love to see a visual of the supermarket, cause I feel like the layout of it could provide a layer of explanations for the results.

Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Graphs don’t have axis labels or titles. I am confused :(

Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

I wish the interpretation linked back to specific graphs. It’s hard to tell what they are looking at and what is going on.

Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

Mostly, seems like they were have trouble lining up a couple graphs. I'm unclear on how big of a deal that is.

Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

Yup! I can’t tell if they tested everything without the added mechanics first though.

Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

I think so. Seems likes they just have to add more to the report.

Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide
Links to an external site.?

Seems like they still have a lot more to add.

Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?

yes...
